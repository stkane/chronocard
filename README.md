Chronocard is drag & drop game where players arrange historical events cards in the correct order. Create your own decks and share them with your friends, family, enemies, etc.

#Levenshtein Distance
Levenshtein Distance (LD) is a measure of the similarity between two strings. I adapted LD slightly to compare two arrays of objects and give players a sense of how close they are to getting the right card order.
